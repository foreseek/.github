# What is foreseek?

**foreseek** is an org maintained by [S-Traut](https://github.com/S-Traut) and [Ballasi](https://github.com/Ballasi)

Its primary use is to have a common place to work on projects we are both interested in working on.

## Who we are?

We're two friends that have been always motivated by the creation of tools and solutions, sometimes for fun, or utility purpose. We're interested in a lot of languages and technologies, but we have preferences for low-level development such as Rust / C.
